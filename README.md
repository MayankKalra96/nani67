### Hi there 👋
**P Nani -- nani67**

I am a _student_ who loves programming and sleeping. My alias is Nandroid, because I started my love for programming through Android app development. I thought to add more info but my brain was eaten by a Zombie. 

**Some things which describes me:**

- 🔭 Placed at Persistent Systems. Will join after lockdown
- 🌱 I'm learning Flutter.
- 👯 II love collaborating with anyone. But I'm kinda shy.
- 💬 Ask me about Flutter, Dialogflow, Firebase, AWS and some stuff you might find interesting.
- ⚡ Fun fact: My relationship with Cakes is like the relationship between body and fat.
